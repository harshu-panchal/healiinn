# Mobile First Layout Rule

description: >
  All pages and components in this application must be designed with a mobile-first layout approach.
  This means that, by default, all user-facing features, components, and pages are optimized for mobile devices
  (small screens) as the primary design target.
  An exception to this rule is the admin module, which may use a different layout approach as required.

rule:
  - When creating new pages or components, always start with a mobile (small screen) design.
  - Ensure layouts, navigation, and interactions prioritize mobile usability and responsiveness.
  - Only the admin module is exempt from this mobile-first requirement.
  - Do not introduce desktop-first designs outside the admin section.
  - Review all designs and code changes for compliance with the mobile-first principle before merging or deploying.

applies_to:
  - All frontend code (components, pages, stylesheets) except the admin module.
  - All team members and contributors.

examples:
  - ✅ Creating a new profile page component with mobile screen breakpoints and touch-friendly controls.
  - ❌ Making a new dashboard page that is only usable on desktop screens (outside admin).

enforcement:
  - Reviewers must check for mobile-first design in code reviews.
  - Any violations should be flagged and revised before merge.
